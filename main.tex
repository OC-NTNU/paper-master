\begin{abstract}

Information extraction can assist researchers by providing structured access to key findings. In traditional information extraction systems, entities are extracted in a first step, and events in a subsequent step. In this paper, we explore information extraction to support research in climate change science. The structure of the information extraction task poses challenges to the canonical pipeline. We therefore explore adapting the extraction pipeline to the task at hand, and show that such customizations can yield improvements for certain tasks.
