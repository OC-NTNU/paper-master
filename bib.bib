                The paper presents an interactive discovery support system for the field of medicine. The intended users of the system are medical researchers. The goal of the system is: for a given starting concept of interest, discover new, potentially meaningful relations with other concepts that have not been published in the medical literature before. The known relations between the medical concepts come from the Medline bibliographic database and the UMLS. We use association rules for discovering the relationship between medical concepts. We evaluated the system by testing how successfully it predicted future discoveries (new relations between concepts). We first divided the Medline database into two segments (older and newer) using the publication date. Then we calculated how many of the new relations found by the system in the older segment become known relations in the newer segment. We found out with statistical significance that the system predicts new relations better then someone predicting randomly. The evaluation showed that our approach for supporting discovery in medicine is successful, but also that some improvements are needed, especially on limiting the number of potential discoveries the system generates.

Currently LBD systems depend exclusively on co-occurrence of words or concepts in target documents, regardless of whether relations actually exist between the words or concepts. We describe a method to enhance LBD through capture of semantic relations from the literature via use of natural language processing (NLP). This paper reports on an application of LBD that combines two NLP systems: BioMedLEE and SemRep, which are coupled with an LBD system called BITOLA.

                Within the peer-reviewed literature, associations between two things are not always recognized until commonalities between them become apparent. These commonalities can provide justification for the inference of a new relationship where none was previously known, and are the basis of most observation-based hypothesis formation. It has been shown that the crux of the problem is not finding inferable associations, which are extraordinarily abundant given the scale-free networks that arise from literature-based associations, but determining which ones are informative. The Mutual Information Measure (MIM) is a well-established method to measure how informative an association is, but is limited to direct (i.e. observable) associations.
                Herein, we attempt to extend the calculation of mutual information to indirect (i.e. inferable) associations by using the MIM of shared associations. Objects of general research interest (e.g. genes, diseases, phenotypes, drugs, ontology categories) found within MEDLINE are used to create a network of associations for evaluation.
                Mutual information calculations can be effectively extended into implied relationships and a significance cutoff estimated from analysis of random word networks. Of the models tested, the shared minimum MIM (MMIM) model is found to correlate best with the observed strength and frequency of known associations. Using three test cases, the MMIM method tends to rank more specific relationships higher than counting the number of shared relationships within a network.

                New relationships are often implicit from existing information, but the amount and growth of published literature limits the scope of analysis an individual can accomplish. Our goal was to develop and test a computational method to identify relationships within scientific reports, such that large sets of relationships between unrelated items could be sought out and statistically ranked for their potential relevance as a set.
                We first construct a network of tentative relationships between 'objects' of biomedical research interest (e.g. genes, diseases, phenotypes, chemicals) by identifying their co-occurrences within all electronically available MEDLINE records. Relationships shared by two unrelated objects are then ranked against a random network model to estimate the statistical significance of any given grouping. When compared against known relationships, we find that this ranking correlates with both the probability and frequency of object co-occurrence, demonstrating the method is well suited to discover novel relationships based upon existing shared relationships. To test this, we identified compounds whose shared relationships predicted they might affect the development and/or progression of cardiac hypertrophy. When laboratory tests were performed in a rodent model, chlorpromazine was found to reduce the progression of cardiac hypertrophy.

    abstract = {{In this paper we utilize methods of hyperdimensional computing to mediate the identification of therapeutically useful connections for the purpose of literature-based discovery. Our approach, named Predication-based Semantic Indexing, is utilized to identify empirically sequences of relationships known as  ” discovery patterns”, such as  ” drug x INHIBITS substance y, substance y CAUSES disease z” that link pharmaceutical substances to diseases they are known to treat. These sequences are derived from semantic predications extracted from the biomedical literature by the SemRep system, and subsequently utilized to direct the search for known treatments for a held out set of diseases. Rapid and efficient inference is accomplished through the application of geometric operators in PSI space, allowing for both the derivation of discovery patterns from a large set of known TREATS relationships, and the application of these discovered patterns to constrain search for therapeutic relationships at scale. Our results include the rediscovery of discovery patterns that have been constructed manually by other authors in previous research, as well as the discovery of a set of previously unrecognized patterns. The application of these patterns to direct search through PSI space results in better recovery of therapeutic relationships than is accomplished with models based on distributional statistics alone. These results demonstrate the utility of efficient approximate inference in geometric space as a means to identify therapeutic relationships, suggesting a role of these methods in drug repurposing efforts. In addition, the results provide strong support for the utility of the discovery pattern approach pioneered by Hristovski and his colleagues. PSI represents concepts and relations in hyperdimensional space. PSI is used to infer discovery patterns from known therapeutic relationships. These patterns are used to recover therapeutic relationships for a held-out disease set.PSI outperforms a co-occurrence based approach in this regard. PSI searches efficiently across large networks of relevant relationships..}},

    abstract = {{This paper addresses the issue of analogical inference, and its potential role as the mediator of new therapeutic discoveries, by using disjunction operators based on quantum connectives to combine many potential reasoning pathways into a single search expression. In it, we extend our previous work in which we developed an approach to analogical retrieval using the Predication-based Semantic Indexing (PSI) model, which encodes both concepts and the relationships between them in high-dimensional vector space. As in our previous work, we leverage the ability of PSI to infer predicate pathways connecting two example concepts, in this case comprising of known therapeutic relationships. For example, given that drug x TREATS disease z, we might infer the predicate pathway drug x INTERACTS\_WITH gene y ASSOCIATED\_WITH disease z, and use this pathway to search for drugs related to another disease in similar ways. As biological systems tend to be characterized by networks of relationships, we evaluate the ability of quantum-inspired operators to mediate inference and retrieval across multiple relations, by testing the ability of different approaches to recover known therapeutic relationships. In addition, we introduce a novel complex vector based implementation of PSI, based on Plate's Circular Holographic Reduced Representations, which we utilize for all experiments in addition to the binary vector based approach we have applied in our previous research.}},

Chance connections made between seemingly distinct subareas sometimes turn out to be fruitful. The goal in text mining is to assist in this process by automatically discovering a small set of interesting hypotheses from a suitable text collection. In this report, we present open and closed text mining algorithms that are built within the discovery framework established by Swanson and Smalheiser. Our algorithms represent topics using metadata profiles. When applied to MEDLINE, these are MeSH based profiles. We present experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms. Specifically, our algorithms successfully generate ranked term lists where the key terms representing novel relationships between topics are ranked high.}},

    abstract = {{Much of the world in Asia, Latin America, and Africa is at an early stage of economic development similar to what the United States and other developed countries experienced many decades ago. Yet, much as their needs for hard and soft infrastructure, effective business practices, and an educated workforce parallel similar needs that underlay earlier development in the West, replicating Western development would overlook the hallmarks of the current century: widely available information and communications technology; a set of electronic linkages among the world; and a global business environment, to name just a few. Consequently, it should be possible to allow developing countries to use  ” leapfrog” technologies that were inconceivable decades ago to support their development. One means of identifying these opportunities is by matching traditional development needs with novel support by connecting previously unrelated literatures.
                            Equally interesting, the poor in many regions are compelled to seek innovative solutions that extend their resources and otherwise make their lives easier. These can include truly surprising hybrids (like washing machine – bicycles) that serve distinct local needs. Yet, these innovations have the potential to be of great value in West, either through direct commercialization or serving as a source of inspiration. These developing world innovations, too, can be linked to currently unrecognized needs or opportunities in the West by proper cross-fertilization. Again, literature-based methods may be an effective means to discover mutual benefits linking the developing and developed worlds.}},

In this paper, a new algorithm is proposed for finding associations between related concepts present in literature.

The resulting concept space allows exploration of the neighborhood of a concept and finding potentially novel relationships between concepts. The obtained information retrieval system is useful for finding literature supporting hypotheses and for discovering previously unknown relationships between concepts.

The prevalent ABC model is not  ” wrong”; however, it is only one of several different types of models that can contribute to the development of the next generation of LBD tools.

Information retrieval, although essential for assembling such fragments, is always problematic. The search process, like a scientific theory, can be criticized and improved, but can never be verified as capable of retrieving all information relevant to a problem or theory. This essential incompleteness of search and retrieval therefore makes possible, and plausible, the existence of undiscovered public knowledge. Three examples intended to throw light on the logic of undiscovered knowledge are constructed and analyzed. The argument is developed within the framework of a Popperian or critical approach within science and on Popper's distinction between subjective and objective knowledge--the distinction between World 2 and World 3.},

                While medical researchers formulate new hypotheses to test, they need to identify connections to their work from other parts of the medical literature. However, the current volume of information has become a great barrier for this task. Recently, many literature-based discovery (LBD) systems have been developed to help researchers identify new knowledge that bridges gaps across distinct sections of the medical literature. Each LBD system uses different methods for mining the connections from text and ranking the identified connections, but none of the currently available LBD evaluation approaches can be used to compare the effectiveness of these methods. In this paper, we present an evaluation methodology for LBD systems that allows comparisons across different systems. We demonstrate the abilities of our evaluation methodology by using it to compare the performance of different correlation-mining and ranking approaches used by existing LBD systems. This evaluation methodology should help other researchers compare approaches, make informed algorithm choices, and ultimately help to improve the performance of LBD systems overall.

This system relies heavily on deep syntactic parsing to build a representation of the relations between drug mentions. In developing the DDI extraction system, we evaluate the suitability of both text-based and database derived features for DDI detection. For machine learning, we test both support vector machine (SVM) and regularized least-squares (RLS) classifiers, with detailed experiments for determining the optimal parameters and training approach. Our system achieves a performance of 62.99 \% F-score on the DDI Extraction 2011 task. 1}},

Our approach enhances a previous extension to LBD, called "discovery browsing," and is implemented using Semantic MEDLINE, which summarizes the results of a PubMed search into an interactive graph of semantic predications. The methodology allows a user to construct argumentation underpinning an answer to a biomedical question by engaging the user in an iterative process between system output and user knowledge. Components of the Semantic MEDLINE output graph identified as "interesting" by the user both contribute to subsequent searches and are constructed into a logical chain of relationships constituting an explanatory network in answer to the initial question. Based on this methodology we suggest that phthalates leached from plastic in critical care interventions activate PPAR gamma, which is anti-inflammatory and abundant in obese patients.}},

    abstract = {{The Arrowsmith two-node search is a strategy that is designed to assist biomedical investigators in formulating and assessing scientific hypotheses. More generally, it allows users to identify biologically meaningful links between any two sets of articles A and C in PubMed, even when these share no articles or authors in common and represent disparate topics or disciplines. The key idea is to relate the two sets of articles via title words and phrases (B-terms) that they share. We have created a free, public web-based version of the two-node search tool (http://arrowsmith.psych.uic.edu), have described its development and implementation, and have presented analyses of individual two-node searches. In this paper, we provide an updated tutorial intended for end-users, that covers the use of the tool for a variety of potential scientific use case scenarios. For example, one can assess a recent experimental, clinical or epidemiologic finding that connects two disparate fields of inquiry--identifying likely mechanisms to explain the finding, and choosing promising follow-up lines of investigation. Alternatively, one can assess whether the existing scientific literature lends indirect support to a hypothesis posed by the user that has not yet been investigated. One can also employ two-node searches to search for novel hypotheses. Arrowsmith provides a service that cannot be carried out feasibly via standard PubMed searches or by other available text mining tools.}},

    abstract = {{We present an extension to literature-based discovery that goes beyond making discoveries to a principled way of navigating through selected aspects of some biomedical domain. The method is a type of "discovery browsing" that guides the user through the research literature on a specified phenomenon. Poorly understood relationships may be explored through novel points of view, and potentially interesting relationships need not be known ahead of time. In a process of "cooperative reciprocity" the user iteratively focuses system output, thus controlling the large number of relationships often generated in literature-based discovery systems. The underlying technology exploits SemRep semantic predications represented as a graph of interconnected nodes (predication arguments) and edges (predicates). The system suggests paths in this graph, which represent chains of relationships. The methodology is illustrated with depressive disorder and focuses on the interaction of inflammation, circadian phenomena, and the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Insight provided may contribute to enhanced understanding of the pathophysiology, treatment, and prevention of this disorder.}},

We investigated the added value of full text over abstracts in terms of information content and occurrences of gene symbol--gene name combinations that can resolve gene-symbol ambiguity. RESULTS: We analyzed a set of 3902 biomedical full-text articles. Different keyword measures indicate that information density is highest in abstracts, but that the information coverage in full texts is much greater than in abstracts. Analysis of five different standard sections of articles shows that the highest information coverage is located in the results section. Still, 30-40\% of the information mentioned in each section is unique to that section. Only 30\% of the gene symbols in the abstract are accompanied by their corresponding names, and a further 8\% of the gene names are found in the full text. In the full text, only 18\% of the gene symbols are accompanied by their gene names.}},

@article{rin03,
    abstract = {{Interpretation of semantic propositions in free-text documents such as MEDLINE citations would provide valuable support for biomedical applications, and several approaches to semantic interpretation are being pursued in the biomedical informatics community. In this paper, we describe a methodology for interpreting linguistic structures that encode hypernymic propositions, in which a more specific concept is in a taxonomic relationship with a more general concept. In order to effectively process these constructions, we exploit underspecified syntactic analysis and structured domain knowledge from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). After introducing the syntactic processing on which our system depends, we focus on the UMLS knowledge that supports interpretation of hypernymic propositions. We first use semantic groups from the Semantic Network to ensure that the two concepts involved are compatible; hierarchical information in the Metathesaurus then determines which concept is more general and which more specific. A preliminary evaluation of a sample based on the semantic group Chemicals and Drugs provides 83\% precision. An error analysis was conducted and potential solutions to the problems encountered are presented. The research discussed here serves as a paradigm for investigating the interaction between domain knowledge and linguistic structure in natural language processing, and could also make a contribution to research on automatic processing of discourse structure. Additional implications of the system we present include its integration in advanced semantic interpretation processors for biomedical text and its use for information extraction in specific domains. The approach has the potential to support a range of applications, including information retrieval and ontology engineering.}},

    abstract = {{While text mining technologies for biomedical research have gained popularity as a way to take advantage of the explosive growth of information in text form in biomedical papers, selecting appropriate natural language processing (NLP) tools is still difficult for researchers who are not familiar with recent advances in NLP. This article provides a comparative evaluation of several state-of-the-art natural language parsers, focusing on the task of extracting protein-protein interaction (PPI) from biomedical papers. We measure how each parser, and its output representation, contributes to accuracy improvement when the parser is used as a component in a PPI system. All the parsers attained improvements in accuracy of PPI extraction. The levels of accuracy obtained with these different parsers vary slightly, while differences in parsing speed are larger. The best accuracy in this work was obtained when we combined Miyao and Tsujii's Enju parser and Charniak and Johnson's reranking parser, and the accuracy is better than the state-of-the-art results on the same data. The PPI extraction system used in this work (AkanePPI) is available online at http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/downloads/downloads.cgi. The evaluated parsers are also available online from each developer's site.}},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Biomedical papers contain rich information about entities, facts and events of biological relevance. To discover these automatically, we use text mining techniques, which rely on annotated corpora for training. In order to extract protein-protein interactions, genotype-phenotype/gene-disease associations, etc., we rely on event corpora that are annotated with classified, structured representations of important facts and findings contained within text. These provide an important resource for the training of domain-specific information extraction (IE) systems, to facilitate semantic-based searching of documents. Correct interpretation of these events is not possible without additional information, e.g., does an event describe a fact, a hypothesis, an experimental result or an analysis of results? How confident is the author about the validity of her analyses? These and other types of information, which we collectively term meta-knowledge, can be derived from the context of the event.RESULTS:We have designed an annotation scheme for meta-knowledge enrichment of biomedical event corpora. The scheme is multi-dimensional, in that each event is annotated for 5 different aspects of meta-knowledge that can be derived from the textual context of the event. Textual clues used to determine the values are also annotated. The scheme is intended to be general enough to allow integration with different types of bio-event annotation, whilst being detailed enough to capture important subtleties in the nature of the meta-knowledge expressed in the text. We report here on both the main features of the annotation scheme, as well as its application to the GENIA event corpus (1000 abstracts with 36,858 events). High levels of inter-annotator agreement have been achieved, falling in the range of 0.84-0.93 Kappa.CONCLUSION:By augmenting event annotations with meta-knowledge, more sophisticated IE systems can be trained, which allow interpretative information to be specified as part of the search criteria. This can assist in a number of important tasks, e.g., finding new experimental knowledge to facilitate database curation, enabling textual inference to detect entailments and contradictions, etc. To our knowledge, our scheme is unique within the field with regards to the diversity of meta-knowledge aspects annotated for each event.}},

    abstract = {<p>Ocean acidification is considered a major threat to marine ecosystems and may particularly affect calcifying organisms such as corals, foraminifera and coccolithophores. Here we investigate the impact of elevated <italic>p</italic>CO<sub>2</sub> and lowered pH on growth and calcification in the common calcareous dinoflagellate <italic>Thoracosphaera heimii</italic>. We observe a substantial reduction in growth rate, calcification and cyst stability of <italic>T. heimii</italic> under elevated <italic>p</italic>CO<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses reveal CO<sub>2</sub> sensitive regulation of many genes, particularly those being associated to inorganic carbon acquisition and calcification. Stable carbon isotope fractionation for organic carbon production increased with increasing <italic>p</italic>CO<sub>2</sub> whereas it decreased for calcification, which suggests interdependence between both processes. We also found a strong effect of <italic>p</italic>CO<sub>2</sub> on the stable oxygen isotopic composition of calcite, in line with earlier observations concerning another <italic>T. heimii</italic> strain. The observed changes in stable oxygen and carbon isotope composition of <italic>T. heimii</italic> cysts may provide an ideal tool for reconstructing past seawater carbonate chemistry, and ultimately past <italic>p</italic>CO<sub>2</sub>. Although the function of calcification in <italic>T. heimii</italic> remains unresolved, this trait likely plays an important role in the ecological and evolutionary success of this species. Acting on calcification as well as growth, ocean acidification may therefore impose a great threat for <italic>T. heimii</italic>.</p>},

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Advanced Text Mining (TM) such as semantic enrichment of papers, event or relation extraction, and intelligent Question Answering have increasingly attracted attention in the bio-medical domain. For such attempts to succeed, text annotation from the biological point of view is indispensable. However, due to the complexity of the task, semantic annotation has never been tried on a large scale, apart from relatively simple term annotation.RESULTS:We have completed a new type of semantic annotation, event annotation, which is an addition to the existing annotations in the GENIA corpus. The corpus has already been annotated with POS (Parts of Speech), syntactic trees, terms, etc. The new annotation was made on half of the GENIA corpus, consisting of 1,000 Medline abstracts. It contains 9,372 sentences in which 36,114 events are identified. The major challenges during event annotation were (1) to design a scheme of annotation which meets specific requirements of text annotation, (2) to achieve biology-oriented annotation which reflect biologists' interpretation of text, and (3) to ensure the homogeneity of annotation quality across annotators. To meet these challenges, we introduced new concepts such as Single-facet Annotation and Semantic Typing, which have collectively contributed to successful completion of a large scale annotation.CONCLUSION:The resulting event-annotated corpus is the largest and one of the best in quality among similar annotation efforts. We expect it to become a valuable resource for NLP (Natural Language Processing)-based TM in the bio-medical domain.},
