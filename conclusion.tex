\section{Conclusion}

It appears that the canonical information extraction pipeline architecture has arisen by accident rather than as the result of a principled design decision, and that changing the order of pipeline components can yield significant improvements for certain domains without the additional complexity caused by joint extraction architectures.

The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the best results can be achieved by extracting the easiest category group first. If correct, this hypothesis not only shows that there can exist extraction tasks for which the traditional bottom-up approach is sub-optimal, but also provides a method for finding the optimal starting point for the extraction pipeline. However, the experiment can not be considered sufficient to prove the hypothesis. Testing this hypothesis across multiple extraction tasks remains a task for future research.
